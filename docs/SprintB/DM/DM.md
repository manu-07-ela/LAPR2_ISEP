# OO Analysis #

The construction process of the domain model is based on the client specifications, especially the nouns (for _concepts_) and verbs (for _relations_) used. 

## Rationale to identify domain conceptual classes ##
To identify domain conceptual classes, start by making a list of candidate conceptual classes inspired by the list of categories suggested in the book "Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development". 


### _Conceptual Class Category List_ ###

**Business Transactions**

### **Rationale to identify associations between conceptual classes**

An association is a relationship between instances of objects that indicates a relevant connection and that is worth of remembering, or it is derivable from the List of Common Associations: 

+ **_A_** is physically or logically part of **_B_**
+ **_A_** is physically or logically contained in/on **_B_**
+ **_A_** is a description for **_B_**
+ **_A_** known/logged/recorded/reported/captured in **_B_**
+ **_A_** uses or manages or owns **_B_**
+ **_A_** is related with a transaction (item) of **_B_**
+ etc.
