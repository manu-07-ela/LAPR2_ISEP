# US 07 - Register a new Employee

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description
*As an Administrator, I want register a new employee.*
### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications
>_**Question:**_ What data characterizes a Manylabs employee?
> 
> [_**Aswer:**_](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=7126#p9455) All the roles that exist in the Many Labs company are characterized by the following attributes:
> * Employee ID;
> * Organization Role;
> * Name;
> * Address;
> * Phone Number;
> * E-Mail;
> * Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code.
> 
> The Specialist Doctor has an additional attribute:
> * Doctor Index Number.

> _**Question:**_ What format should the phone number be?
>
> [_**Aswer:**_](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=7153#p9462) Phone number : 11 digits number

>_**Question:**_ When creating a new employee, the attributes "Employee ID" and "Doctor Index Number", are implemented by the administrator or incremented by the system?
> 
> [_**Aswer:**_](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=7547#p10159) Only the employee ID should be generated from the initials of the employee name and should include a number. The number has 5 digits and is increases automatically when a new employee is registered in the system.
> The Doctor Index Number should be introduced by the administrator.



### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria
- *_AC1:_* Each user must have a single role defined in the System. 
- *_AC2:_* The "auth" component available on the repository must be reused (without modifications)

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies
* All employees created need to be a user of System

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
    * a name,
    * an address,
    * a phone number,
    * an email,
    * a SOC code,
    * the doctor index number

* Selected data:
    * user role


**Output Data:**

* (In)Success of the operation

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

*Use this section to capture other relevant information that is related with this US such as (i) special requirements ; (ii) data and/or technology variations; (iii) how often this US is held.* 


## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt 
*In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the domain model that is seen as relevant to fulfill this requirement.*

### 2.2. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).* 



## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |... interacting with the actor? |CreateEmployeeUI| Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model.|
| Step 2  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 3  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 4  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 5  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 6  		 |							 |             |                              |              

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Class1
 * Class2
 * Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * xxxxUI  
 * xxxxController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.* 

![USXX-SD](USXX-SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
