# US05 - Record the samples collected in the scope of a given test.

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

*As a medical lab technician, I want to record the samples collected in the scope of a
given test.*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

> The client should wait until a medical lab technician calls him/her
to collect the samples required to perform a given test.

> All the tests (clinical blood tests and Covid-19 tests) performed by the network of laboratories are
registered locally by the medical lab technicians who collect the samples.

> When sampling (blood or swab) the medical lab technician records the samples in the system,
associating the samples with the client/test, and identifying each sample with a barcode that is
automatically generated using an external API.

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** What kind of attributes should a sample have?
> 
> [**Answer:**](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8244#p10890) Each sample is associated with a test. A sample has only one attribute, a barcode number (UPC) that is a sequential number and is automatically generated by the system. Each sample has a unique barcode number.


> [In US5, the medical lab technician checks the system and see all tests for which there are no samples collected. The medical lab technician selects a test and the system asks for the number of samples to collect.](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8244#p10890)

> **Question:** Can a test have more than one sample?
> 
>  [**Answer:**](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8244#p10890) Yes.


> **Question:** We didn't fully understand what will the API do in this US, so here's out interpretation from the US, correct us if we're wrong please: The API will be generated randomly and the API is an attribute from the sample.
> 
>  [**Answer:**](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8244#p10890) The API will be used to generate/print barcodes.

> **Question:** What information does the medical lab technician needs to input to the record a new sample?
> 
>  [**Answer:**](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8360#p11021) The medical lab technician checks a list of tests and selects one. Then, the application generates barcodes (one or more). After printing the barcodes (one or more) the use case ends.

> **Question:** During the current sprint, how should we allow the barcodes to be printed? After generating them via the API, should we save the barcode images to the disk?
> 
>  [**Answer:**](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8491#p11182) Each generated barcode should be saved in a folder as a jpeg file.

> **Question:** It was answered in one of the previous questions that the sample only has one attribute, the barcode, however the description of the project also mentions a date of collection of the samples, is this date supposed to be an attribute of the test and not of the sample itself?
> 
> [**Answer:**](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8450#p11178) Yes. The system should record the date (DD/MM/YYYY) and time (HH:MM) when the sample is collect made. The date and time are automatically generated by the system when the barcode is issued.

> **Question:** If there were multiple samples for a single test, would there be only one collection date for all of them?
> 
>  [**Answer:**](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8450#p11178) Only one collection date and time for a test.

> **Question:** Shouldn't there be a way for technicians to add more samples to an existing test?
>
>  [**Answer:**](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8437#p11175) No.

> **Question:**  Should there be a validation of the number of samples?
>
>  [**Answer:**](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8437#p11175) No.


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- *_AC1:_* The system should support several barcode APIs. 
  
- *_AC2:_* The API to use is defined by configuration.
  
- *_AC3:_* A test can have more than one sample.

- *_AC4:_* The date and time associated with a sample must be automatically generated by the system.

- *_AC5:_* Each samples has a unique barcode number.

- *_AC6:_* All bar codes generated must be saved in jpeg format in a file.

- *_AC7:_* After certain samples have been associated with a test, it is not possible to associate more samples with that test.

- *_AC8:_* The date must be in the format DD/MM/YYYY.

- *_AC9:_* The time must have the following format HH:MM.




### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* This user story has a dependency with user story 4 since it is only possible to collect and identify samples from a test registered.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
  * The number of samples associated with a test

* Selected data:
  * The test waiting to be associated with a sample

* Automatically generated data:
  * Barcode
  * Data
  * Time
  
**Output Data:**

* The barcodes associated with the samples were recorded

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

* This user story will be used during the entire operation of the system, since, every test performed by Many labs requires sample collection.

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Employee
 * Sample
 * Test
 * Client 


Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * RecordSampleUI  
 * RecordSampleController

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
